# New Feature 

Problem: so my vercel function invocation and memory usage is still high even with ISR, because song pages call 3 apis, related, song itself and then tamil songs,  I read today that vercel blob can be used to store JSON files and one single api can take data from json, here is my thought

1) create json file for each song which will have all details, song content, tamil song content and related songs ( only movie) and of course meta, I  mean complete data on one single song. this can be create by looping through each blogger post api, similar to sitemap creation loop 
2) above will produce say 2000 json or more and it will grow
3) push them to blob via client upload  ( no cost invoved in update ) 
4) song page will look for json file based on song slug and retreice JSON data else it should fall back to existing blogger api calls 
5) since we will be calling method to get json data, it will be quick and only one hit instead of 3 hits
